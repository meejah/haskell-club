Week 2 notes:

 - lists are actually linked-lists

 - colon operator is like prepend an element (dicussing the colon in
   "pattern matching" vs. implementation, e.g. see Ram's or JP's
   answers)

 - pattern-matching operators aren't "special"

 - pattern-matching "things" are actually constructors

   evaluation (i.e. normally doesn't even "take a thing out" of the
   list
